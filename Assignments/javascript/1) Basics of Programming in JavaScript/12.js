// booleans & comparison operator 

// booleans 
// true, false 

// let num1 = 7;
// let num2 = "7";

// console.log(num1<num2);

// == vs ===  
//"==" don't check for data type whereas "===" checks for data types also
// console.log(num1 === num2);

// != vs !== same as for equality operators

// console.log(num1 !== num2);

//In other programming languages we don't have this "===" and "!==" operator
//simple equality operators ("==") and "!=" in other programming languages 
//checks for data types also
